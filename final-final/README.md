I have explained why I decided to change my website in the README.md file in the "final project-with typewriter effect" folder

I found myself constantly jumping from ideas to ideas, hence the re-making of everthing half way through. I didnt put that much emphasis on populating the content of the page, in fact I didnt really know what I wanted to host on my website till later, but I leanred a lot by looking at other people's code and trying to dissect their code to understand the bigger parts. I also learned that I shouldn't let fancy animations cool effects distract myself from making the functionalities of the website cater to the content. 

Frankly speaking I was not that excited about the turnout of my final project, but one thing I am proud of is that I wrote everything, no copy pasting, no "it worked but I dont know why"... It's far from the best, but it got me on board with front-end web dev

I used sass, really cool! But becuase I didnt have that much CSS specificity, it wasn't particularly helpful in this project. 

Also I know I should have put all js code in separate files, but becuase I had individual pages, it was easier for me test out everthing by keeping it at the bottom. 

Learned a lot, thanks for a great semester! :)
