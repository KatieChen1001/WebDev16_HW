Wireframing is a great of visualizing the layout of the website before commiting to writing semantic markup language. I think of wireframing as a form of 2D rendering of the website, whereas HTML semantics are more like a linear representation. 

The five questions that the author always asks herself before doing any wireframing, the "who is it for" question struck me as particularly important. When doing the recipe breakdown, I found a couple of websites that definitely were targetting at the foodie expert, rather than a rookie like me. At the top of the website "epicurious", the search bar includes a more than adequeate amout of filter. The saerch bar is followed by numerous blog posts. The website prioritizes the people search for a specific recipe, but also immediately offers those who are just wondering about what to have for dinner, or looking to try out new recipes a great source of information.
