		<h2> Poached Egg and Avocado Breakfast Salad </h2>
		<p>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!</p>
		<p>That is right, eating breakfast can keep you from packing on the pounds. In fact, in a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, researchers found that those who skipped breakfast were more likely to be not just overweight, but obese! The same study found that frequently eating breakfast away from home was also linked with obesity. Even if youâ€™re consciously cutting calories to lose weight, skipping breakfast is still a bad idea. Researchers from the University of Missouri found that eating a high-protein breakfast meant participants felt fuller throughout the day and ate a smaller dinner and fewer snacks. Eating a low-protein breakfast or no breakfast made subjects more likely to graze on unhealthy snacks during the day. And, an Israeli study found that women who ate half their daily calories at breakfast lost an average of 19 pounds in 3 months!</p>
		<p>Expecting your body to run on empty from dinner time right through to lunchtime the next day just isnâ€™t healthy. Food is fuel for the body, so eating a nutritious breakfast means youâ€™ll have enough energy to burn, keeping you active and productive until lunch rolls around. Back to the Top!</p>
