This is the version (with typewriter effect mentioned in the proposal)
But then I decided that this does not serve the purpose of my wesbite (which instead of showcasing the work and projects I have done, now serves as a placeholder for all the design works I find inspiring), as explained in part in my documentation. 

I wanted a typewritter effect and then a counter up to take people from the 1996 to the modern world, though I was able to achieve both functionalities, they did not necessarily deliver the effect I wanted. And there were to much inconsistency jumping from the opening to the counterUp to the actual page. So I decided to change it. 

Ultimate test run folder includes all the small features I have tested while working on the project
