		“A book is a heart that only beats in the chest of another”
		<br><br>
		"Literary experience heals the wound, without undermining the privilege, of individuality. There are mass emotions which heal the wound; but they destroy the privilege. In them our separate selves are pooled and we sink back into sub-individuality. But in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like a night sky in the Greek poem, I see with a myriad eyes, but it is still I who see. Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do." --- C.S.Lewis

		"When you watch TV or see a film, you are looking at things happening to other people. Prose fiction is something you build up from twenty-six letters and a handful of punctuation marks, and you, and you alone, using your imagination, create a world, and people it and look out through other eyes. You get to feel things, visit places and worlds you would never otherwise know. You learn that everyone else out there is a me, as well. You’re being someone else, and when you return to your own world, you’re going to be slightly changed." --- Neil Gaiman

		For Kafka, reading was "the axe for the frozen sea within us"; for James Baldwin, reading was "a way to change ur destiny"; for E.B. White, reading was "the work of the alert mind"; for Carl Sagan, "a book is proof that humans are capcable of working magic"....
